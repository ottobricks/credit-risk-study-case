# Credit Risk - Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to my case study regarding credit risk for MaxAB. I must first emphasize that this is a simplistic approach to prevent retailers from contracting loans at high risk of defaulting. In this vein, the case study is framed as a binary classification problem and a final answer in the form of "yes" or "no" should dictate whether a loan is approved.

In order to conduct the case study, I was provided with 3 data sets:
- loans by retailer
- fintech transactions by retailer
- ecommerce orders by retailer

It goes without saying that this exercise can be enriched with many different data sources -- e.g. CBE interest rate, inflation, information about retailers business segment, age of business, etc. But for the sake of brevity, I'll work only with the data sets provided.

I decided to set aside some time to go over the design and components of my (proposal) for a more mature automated decision-making system and suggestions about the current loan process in chapter [Credit Risk Decision API](./decision-api/overview.md). Of course, it won't be extensive nor exhaustive of the possibilities since I must time-box it.

The chapters in this book are meant to be read in order as they reflect the natural flow of exploration, then experimentation, then results.
