What is the purpose of Data Science?

At its best, Data Science is a resourceful tool to make informed decisions, if compared to old-school hunch-in-the-gut decision making. Basing decisions on gut feelings or small samples of data puts a team, and sometimes a whole company, at risk due to unknown or undisclosed bias and motivations.

So, Data Science is here to save the day, right? Not exactly.

A tool is only as good as the person yielding it. Many practitioners end up making the same mistakes of the past, but with fancier laptops and jargon. What is that mistake? One's desire for success can sometimes overrule better judgment and hide the risk it entails. Most of the time, it's an honest mistake of trying to please, help the team get to short-term goals, etc -- seldom it's greed or pride, and rarely malicious.

So how can Data Science be used in the proper way and bring dividends in the long run?

The best way to mitigate the risk of one's conscious and unconscious bias is to address is straight on. What does that mean? It means gathering enough domain and problem understanding to form your opinion about what you expect the solution or answer to a decision be, and making one or several predictions before doing any analysis on the data. One more crucial step is to then make explicit scenarios or evidence that would make you lose confidence in your predictions, and perhaps bend towards alternative ideas. In summary:
 - state the problem clearly
 - state your initial opinion of what outcome you expect -- **make predictions**
 - state what evidence would make you lose confidence in your predictions
 - use the data to test your predictions
 - gather results, brainstorm and repeat

All of those steps are part of the Scientific Method, and that's what Data Science at its best brings to the table. Now, let's follow suit and talk about our predictions to be tests, also known as hypothesis.
