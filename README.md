# Credit Risk - Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to my case study regarding credit risk for MaxAB. I must first emphasize that this is a simplistic approach to prevent retailers from contracting loans at high risk of defaulting. In this vein, the case study is framed as a binary classification problem and a final answer in the form of "yes" or "no" should dictate whether a loan is approved.

In order to conduct the case study, I was provided with 3 data sets:
- loans by retailer
- fintech transactions by retailer
- ecommerce orders by retailer
